# Digital-Image-Processing
The college assignment processing an image

Task 1
- Transformation into a binary image using thresholding
- Transformation into a negative image
- Increase image brightness using the b value and constant
- Image conversion using RGB. average value
- Combine two images using the equation
- Boolean logic operations on two images
- Rotation, flip, and zoom operations on the image

Task 2
- Edge detection with Laplace operator, Laplace of Gaussian (LoG), and Canny filter
- Image Filtering with Sobel, Prewitt, and Roberts

Task 3
- Image transformation to color's model YCbCr, HSI, YIQ, and YUV
- Thresholding with the otsu method - Using segmentation and biner operation to remove a small part of hole in the Image
- Segmentation with K-Mean

Task 4
- Segmentation image is like following example:
